Role Quick Changer is the simple solution to an age old WordPress debugging problem. "How do I see what this page looks like for a subscriber?". Well, normally you'd have to create a new user with that role and then log in as them, what a pain. Not to mention, you'd have to do this for EVERY role you want to test. Role Quick Changer to the rescue! Now you can do test any page as any role which simply by selecting the role from the admin bar. No need to even create a new user.

Simply install and activate the plugin and then select the role to test from the drop-down in the admin bar. It couldn't be any simpler.
